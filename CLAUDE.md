# Stayful Intelligence knowledge (Batch 24)

Any change to a feature, price, limit or rule must add or update the matching
Stayful Intelligence knowledge entries (as drafts for Zac to approve, in
`src/lib/knowledge/seed.ts`), and every figure must be a placeholder resolved
from settings (`src/lib/knowledge/placeholders.ts`), never typed into an
answer. If the change adds or moves something the nightly job drafts from,
update `src/lib/knowledge/service-facts.ts` too. See
`src/lib/knowledge/README.md`.

# Bug check before handing back

- Did this change a feature, price, limit or rule? Then the matching
  knowledge entries are added or updated in `src/lib/knowledge/seed.ts` as
  drafts (never approved in code), every figure in them is a `{placeholder}`
  resolved from settings, and `npm test` passes (the seed tests check every
  placeholder resolves against the schema's seeds and no answer types a
  figure).
